# AA_Assignment1

Source code encapsulating the requirements for the completion of Algorithms and Analysis - Assignment 1 (S1 2019).

The project required me to build an application - generator more specifically, that can generate a perfect maze given size constraints.

Additionally, two maze solvers (Kruskal and HuntAndKill) where required to be written from pre-existing algorithms to navigate and solve the 
generated maze.
